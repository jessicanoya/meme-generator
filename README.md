# meme-generator

For this assignment, youâ€™ll be building a meme generator in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Your generator should consist of a form that accepts a link to an image, text for the top of the meme, and text for the bottom of the meme. When the user submits the form, use JavaScript to append to the DOM a div which contains the meme, including the image and its text.

**Requirements**
* The HTML page shows a form with three input options - Top Text, Bottom Text, Image - and a submit button
* Users should be able to submit a form on the page to generate a new meme on the page
* They should be able to add multiple memes to the page by submitting the form multiple times
* Users should be able to click on a button to delete/remove a meme from the page
* The form boxes should clear out automatically after the submit is clicked
* The form fields need to have validation so they will not submit if a field is missing
* Be sure to style your meme generator! It should be functional but also look nice
* Only use vanilla JavaScript: no frameworks/third-party libraries are allowed
